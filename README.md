# Machine Learning Studies

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is dedicated to my journey in learning machine learning. As I explore various concepts, techniques, and tools in this field, I'll be using this repository to store code, notes, and other resources.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal learning tool and a place to document my progress. It will include:

- **Scripts**: Python scripts and functions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Datasets**: Examples of datasets used for different machine learning tasks.
- **Resources**: Links to articles, papers, and tutorials that have been helpful in my learning process.
- **Projects**: Eventually, I plan to include projects that showcase different machine learning techniques.

## Goals

1. **Learning**: To understand and implement various machine learning algorithms and techniques.
2. **Documentation**: To document my learning process and make it easier to review and share.
3. **Application**: To apply machine learning concepts to real-world problems and datasets.

## Future Plans

As I continue to learn and grow in the field of machine learning, I will be updating this repository with:

- Detailed project examples.
- Jupyter notebooks with experiments and notes.
- Additional scripts and functions for machine learning tasks.
- Comprehensive documentation and resources.
